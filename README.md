**Player 2** - will try to guess the word typing the letters which he thinks be correct. The player has only 5 lifes to do that, be careful.

I hope you enjoy the game, it was fully made by me as a challenge to my learning. I like these type of challenges. ðŸ˜„

Be free to contribute with my learning doing a PR to show your way to do that game.
